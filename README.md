This dataset comprises two main tables. The first table includes columns such as 'movie_id,' 'primary_title,' 'start_year,' 'runtime_minutes,' 'genres,' and 'movie_rating.' These columns provide information about various movies, including their titles, release years, durations, genres, and ratings.

The second table, on the other hand, contains columns like 'id,' 'release_date,' 'movie,' 'production_budget,' 'domestic_gross,' and 'worldwide_gross.'
